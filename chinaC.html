			<h1>China</h1>
			<p>China (simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國 Pinyin: Zhōngguó) is a cultural region, an ancient civilization, and a nation in East Asia. The official name is People's Republic of China or PRC.

                The last Chinese Civil War (1927–1949) resulted in two different political powers today:
                
                Taiwan The Republic of China (ROC) (since 1911), commonly known as China since 1 January, 1911 to 25 October, 1971. Now commonly known as Taiwan, has control over the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.
                China The People's Republic of China (PRC) (since 1949), commonly known as China, has control over mainland China and the largely self-governing territories of Hong Kong (since 1997) and Macau (since 1999).
                China is one of the world's oldest civilizations: it has the oldest continuous civilization near the Yellow River region.[18] There is archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old.[19] China also has one of the world's oldest writing systems (and the oldest in use today). China has been the source of many major inventions.[19] Geographically, China’s longest river is the Yangtze River which runs through mega cities and is home to many species. It is the world’s third longest river.</p>
